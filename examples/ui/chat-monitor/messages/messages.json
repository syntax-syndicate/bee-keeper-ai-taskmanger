Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\\n\\nThe best French restaurants in Boston\\n\\n1. Troquet on South\\n\\nThis unassuming restaurant in the city’s Leather District gained a cult following from neighborhood fans and business folks alike for its seamless blend of New American and French cuisines. The bistro is elegant and sexy without the pretense of an exclusive Parisian eatery, yet it serves fine dining plates to create a superior quality experience. The frisée salad is a favorite starter, while the rotating entrees usually feature a lamb rack and chicken dish that are to die for.\\n\\n2. Deuxave\\n\\nThis Back Bay storefront blends in with its townhouse surrounds, so unless you’re in the know, you’d likely walk right past it. The haute bar, which boasts only a few high-tops, is an intimate spot for a date, while the back room, centered around a fireplace, is cozy and dimly lit—just like what you might find wandering into a Parisian fine dining establishment. The menu changes with the season, however, you can always expect to find duck in various forms—from pâté to confit to breast—as well as a chicken Giannone that will forever set the bar for ordering poultry on a night out.\\n\\n3. Petit Robert Bistro\\n\\nIf you’re craving steak frites or coq au vin, this South End address is here to satiate. The elegantly styled French bistro serves a number of unique French dishes at both lunch and dinner (like calf’s liver with onions and beef tartare), all of which can be perfectly paired with a selection off of its lengthy French wine list. No matter what time of day that you visit, just don’t skip the baguette, an elevated offering on a bread course you won’t want to miss.\\n\\n4. Cafe Sauvage\\n\\nSet a few streets over from Newbury in the Back Bay, Cafe Sauvage is a neighborhood-first spot. With a welcoming atmosphere, this place serves up French treats throughout the week days (chocolate croissants, croque madames and savory, plus sweet crêpes) as well as a weekend brunch. With a French wine list, it’s just as much of a place to meet for a cafe au lait as it is for a Bordeaux blend.\\n\\n5. Ma Maison\\n\\nA definitive name in Beacon Hill, Chef Jacky Robert’s French brasserie serves up any French classic you could possibly crave—from escargots and moules frites to cheese fondue and frog legs. The intimate bar also serves up a selection of regional aperitifs so you can sit down for L’Apéro, including Americano, Lillet Blanc and Martini Rouge, served neat or mixed into the cocktails offered on their limited but unique drink menu.\\n\\n6. Coquette\\n\\nSituated inside the Seaport’s newest hotel, the Omni Boston, the whimsically pastel-lined walls of Coquette transport diners to the Basque Country, where French and Spanish coastal influences appear on menu items like clams gratiné and tuna au poivre. There are also small bites, more similar to the Spanish influence of tapas but still feature the flavors of France, like the mussels picante and joues de bouef.\\n\\n7. Aquitaine\\n\\nThe garnet interiors and minimalist-branded plates exude a true French bistro experience before you even sit down. A slew of French classics appear on this menu, however, a few of our favorites include duck à l’orange and sole meunière. For something a little less traditional but remarkably flavorful, opt for the truffle burger made with dry aged beef and truffle sauce, and served on a toasted potato bun.\\n\\n8. Rochambeau\\n\\nTraditionally French yet creatively Boston, this behemoth space is spread across a casual bar and eatery, elevated upstairs dining room and daytime cafe, where French pastries call your name. The escargot and charred octopus make an ideal first bite before ordering the divinely filling côte de boeuf or classic bolognese.\\n\\n9. La Voile\\n\\nBasked in a deep mahogany glow, the ruby interiors of this underground, Newbury Street venue contribute a suave atmosphere to its sophisticated menu. Inspired by the original Cannes restaurant, La Voile au Vent (The Sail in the Wind), founded in 1947, much of the decor, including the vintage chandelier and sailing art, now adorns Boston’s La Voile. This authentic history translates to the menu, where foie gras, French onion soup and cassoulet tantalize you to order more and more.\\n\\n10. No. 9 Park\\n\\nOpened in 1998 as Barbara Lynch’s first restaurant venture, No. 9 Park still lives in its original edifice and is synonymous with unmatched quality. Though you can opt for à la carte, the tasting menu is No. 9 Park’s hallmark, including rotating dishes all grounded in French cuisine. One thing you can guarantee to grace the menu? The prune-stuffed gnocchi with foie gras, almond and vin santo, which has been a founding menu item and continues to be as tasty as it is timeless.\\n\\nBeen there, done that?

Eventually, though, this fusion-cooking pioneer and Maîtres Cuisiniers de France (Master Chefs of France) inductee spawned his own culinary revolution—first in San Francisco, then back in Boston where he opened multiple locations of Petit Robert Bistro. He’s since moved on from those restaurants, and now you’ll find him at Ma Maison, his most traditional and personal dining room. Adorned with silver trays, wine bottles, and white tablecloths, the homey Beacon Hill charmer is the picture-perfect setting to dine on beef bourguignon, frog legs, and other classics.\\n\\n272 Cambridge St., Beacon Hill, Boston, 617-725-8855, mamaisonboston.com.\\n\\nDover sole meunière at Mistral. / Courtesy photo\\n\\nMistral\\n\\nThe first—and arguably most famous—Jamie Mammano production under the Columbus Hospitality Group umbrella has been serving some of Boston’s finest French-Mediterranean cuisine since 1997. Named for the wind that blows through the South of France, Mistral helped move the center of buzz in Boston’s dining scene to the Back Bay-South End borderline when it opened. Since then, the whole city has exploded—yet Mistral remains en vogue thanks to its delicate balancing of flavors. See the robust dried cherry gastrique drizzled over seared foie gras or the warm, buttery lemon caper sauce poured over delicate Dover sole. A single meal may max out much of your rainy-day fund, but c’est la vie.\\n\\n223 Columbus Ave., South End, Boston, 617-867-9300, mistralbistro.com.\\n\\nPetit Robert Bistro\\n\\nBest of Boston winner, 2007\\n\\nIf you ignore the peek-a-boo view of the Prudential Center behind the church across the street, you can almost imagine that this South End bistro is parked right by Notre-Dame. Petit Robert is the perfect place to live out your French fantasy—and contemplate which Parisian arrondissement would suit you best—while digging into foie de veau Lyonnaise topped with caramelized onions or plump pumpkin ravioli with wild mushrooms. Church bells will ring as you raise a glass of Sauvignon Blanc to your adventurous (and very well-fed) alter-ego. (Looking for more casual fare? Check Petit Robert’s sibling café, PRB Boulangerie, with locations in Somerville, the South End, and Cambridge. The latter is right by Batifol, which is also owned by the same group.)\\n\\n480 Columbus Ave., South End, Boston, 617-867-0600, petitrobertbistro.com.\\n\\nA duck dish at Rochambeau. / Courtesy photo\\n\\nRochambeau\\n\\nThis trendy Back Bay spot delivers—and at a reasonable price point—on fine French-inspired food served with a side of flash. There’s certainly frisky energy to the place, starting with the Art Nouveau-inspired architecture and mid-century modern millennial pink chairs. Bring a crowd, pop some bubbly, order lots of hors d’oeuvres, and dive into some Parisian gnocchi or Marseille-style mussels accordingly. Looking for something meatier? Head to the first-floor dining room, which transformed into the “Steak Room” in early 2024, exclusively serving a prix fixe menu centered around steak frites.\\n\\n900 Boylston St., Back Bay, Boston, 617-247-0400, rochambeauboston.com.\\n\\nTroquet on South\\n\\nWhen this cozy French-New American bistro moved from its Boylston Street location to a much roomier space in the Leather District, Bostonians breathed a collective sigh of relief. Now everyone has the space to lean into a laissez-faire mindset and order as much wine as they please off owner-sommelier Chris Campbell’s award-winning list. Besides the magnifique beverage options, Troquet on South offers new takes on French staples with dishes like duck à l’orange with Puy lentils or a melt-in-your-mouth ribeye with bone marrow butter. If you want the full royal treatment, opt for the five- or seven-course tasting menu, which is bound to satisfy.\\n\\n107 South St., Leather District, Boston, 617-695-9463, troquetboston.com.\\n\\nFrench-ish Restaurants\\n\\nWhile not explicitly French, these great local spots draw inspiration from the cuisine.\\n\\nBlue Ribbon Brasserie’s shrimp Provençal: cheese ravioli and spinach. / Photo by Rachel Leah Blumenthal\\n\\nBlue Ribbon Brasserie\\n\\nNew York-based restaurateurs Bruce and Eric Bromberg brought their successful Blue Ribbon Brasserie to Boston’s Kenmore Square in late 2023. The restaurant draws much of its inspiration (including the “brasserie” designation) from the brothers’ training in France, so there are certainly some French dishes on the menu, including steak frites and escargots à la bourguignonne. There’s also the shrimp Provençal, a nod to a dish the brothers learned while summering in Provence as kids that inspired their eventual path to the culinary arts. But “French” doesn’t seem like quite the right descriptor when the menu also includes matzoh ball soup; a “pupu platter” that includes pierogi, Buffalo cauliflower, and ribs; fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens; and two variations on paella. You can scratch your itch for French food here, but it’s a genre-hopping restaurant for all occasions, and that’s not a bad thing.\\n\\n528 Commonwealth Ave., Kenmore Square, Boston, 617-634-0404, blueribbonbrasserieboston.com.\\n\\nEastern Standard steak frites. / Photo by Rachel Leah Blumenthal\\n\\nEastern Standard\\n\\nAlso firmly in the brasserie camp is Boston’s own Eastern Standard, which for nearly 15 years was located in the space now occupied by Blue Ribbon. It was reborn in a shiny new space nearby in late 2023, to the joy of many a Boston diner, and continues to be a standard-bearer for the modern sort-of-French, sort-of-American brasserie, the type of place you can go for a cozy weekday lunch or date-night dinner or hearty late-night snack. Those seeking French cuisine will find excellent versions of steak tartare, steak frites, a niçoise salad, and more.\\n\\n775 Beacon St. (in the Bower), Fenway/Kenmore, Boston, 617-530-1590, easternstandardboston.com.\\n\\nJuliet’s hake meunière. / Photo by Rachel Leah Blumenthal\\n\\nJuliet\\n\\nThis Union Square gem describes itself as “mostly French, totally fun, and inspired heavily by the region of Nice”—which in turn brings in some Italian influence, due to Nice’s proximity to Italy. And then there are Juliet’s rotating prix fixe menus that trot around the globe, from an ode to north California to a yearly celebration of the Persian new year, Nowruz. Not to mention random bits of fun like fish fry Friday or a Texas barbecue special. All this to say: Juliet does a lot of things. But at its mostly-French heart, there are rich omelettes (among the best in town); fancy aioli with lots of things to dip in it; several styles of moules frites; steak frites; hake meunière; and lots more.\\n\\n263 Washington St., Union Square, Somerville, 617-718-0262, julietsomerville.com.\\n\\nZuzu’s Petals in Cambridge.

The first Boston restaurant from NYC-based Major Food Group, whose portfolio includes Michelin-starred restaurants around the world, Contessa is a glitzy rooftop destination at the Newbury Hotel. The big buzz and stunning views through walls of windows might get you in the door, but the fantastic and highly-finessed contemporary Italian cuisine—sumptuous pastas (spicy lobster capellini), fancified pizzas (topped with littleneck clams or black truffle, perhaps) and a signature Florentine-style steak for two—will keep you coming back.

You won’t regret it.\\n\\nAlso featured in:\\n\\n8 Best Bets for Boston’s Restaurant Week\\n\\nLa Morra\\n\\nThis Brookline mainstay tends to lean in the direction of northern Italy, based on owners Josh and Jen Ziskin’s time in Italy’s Piedmont region. For a taste of as much of the menu as possible, try the prix-fixe menu with optional wine pairings.\\n\\nAlso featured in:\\n\\n10 Restaurants Offering Takeout or Delivery for Dine Out Boston\\n\\nThe 38 Essential Boston Restaurants, April 2013\\n\\nTonino\\n\\nThis Jamaica Plain gem has garnered an enthusiastic following since it opened in October 2022. It’s hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but look especially for the taleggio cappelletti drizzled with aged balsamic, the bowl of countneck clams, and the Roman-style pizza bianca with excellent pairings including whipped ‘nduja and stracciatella, ricotta and hot honey, and eggplant caponata.\\n\\nAlso featured in:\\n\\nThe 38 Best Restaurants Around Boston\\n\\nThe 15 Most Romantic Restaurants Around Boston\\n\\nVia Cannuccia\\n\\nChef Stefano Quaresima transports customers direct to Italy at this spot on Dorchester Avenue. Roman through and through, this trattoria is a bakery by day — putting out some of Boston’s freshest and tastiest pastries thanks to their lievito madre (sourdough starter) — and a restaurant by night. Stop by on the weekend to sample their brunch, where you can taste a cream-filled maritozzo. Then, come back in the evening for an unforgettable dining experience that will make you question if you’re in Dorchester or Anzio, Quaresima’s hometown south of Rome.\\n\\nAlso featured in:\\n\\nThe Best Brunches Around Boston, According to Eater Editors\\n\\nThe Best New Restaurants Around Boston Right Now, According to Eater Editors\\n\\nMore in Maps\\n\\nGiulia\\n\\nGiulia is serving some of the best fresh pasta in the city. If available, get the pappardelle with wild boar, but diners can’t go wrong with any of the options, from duck wing ravioli to squash and sweet potato agnolotti. Plan out dinner here well in advance; reservations are difficult to snag.\\n\\nRino's Place\\n\\nRino’s Place in East Boston has the hard-to-find lovability of locals and tourists alike. This is no-frills, classic Italian American checker-tablecloth dining. The ravioli are made to order, and no meal is complete without a plate of crispy calamari for the table. Come hungry; portions tend toward gigantic. (No reservations; walk-ins only.)\\n\\nPammy's\\n\\nPammy’s is not quite Italian — the restaurant describes itself as “a New American restaurant inspired by the feel of an Italian neighborhood trattoria” — but it pulls from Italian cuisine enough (and is good enough) that it’s worth including here. Negronis are served on draft, and the pasta is made from scratch, down to the flour being milled in-house. Don’t ignore the lumache, served with a Bolognese sauce that’s kicked up with spicy Korean gochujang.\\n\\nCarmelina's\\n\\nThe North End is awash in Italian restaurants — this is arguably the U.S.’s most famous Little Italy, after all — but there are a few spots that stand out amid a sea of spaghetti. Carmelina’s is one of those restaurants. The menu is rooted in coastal Sicilian fare, which means there’s a lot of seafood (mussels, calamari, shrimp, clams, you name it) and there’s also a ton of pasta, from carbonara and fettuccine to Carmelina’s famed Sunday Macaroni, with penne, meatballs, Sulmona sausage, and beef rib tossed in a tomato sauce and a dollop of whipped ricotta on top.\\n\\nCarlo's Cucina Italiana\\n\\nFor loaded Italian plates and a more casual atmosphere, head to Carlo’s Cucina Italiana in Allston. This family-owned and operated spot has been dishing out saltimbocca and Sunday sauce since the 1970s. They also offer a hearty lunch menu with packed paninis and savory pasta.\\n\\nLa Padrona\\n\\nLa Padrona — the glamorous Italian restaurant that opened in Raffles last May — is a bona-fide hit. The restaurant, which was named Eater Boston’s Best New Restaurant of 2024, nails both the environment and the execution, starting with the grand staircase that diners ascend to get to the showstopping dining room. Then there’s dinner itself, which will likely involve many courses of appetizers (you can’t go wrong with the chickpea spoon bread and the tuna crudo), luxurious pasta, and even more luxurious centerpiece plates like roasted rack of lamb or the dry-aged 40-ounce porterhouse steak with grilled focaccia.\\n\\nStandard Italian\\n\\nAn offshoot of the Eastern Standard mothership, Standard Italian is holding its own in Fenway. Chef Brian Rae, an alum of famed Cambridge Italian restaurant Rialto, leads a crowd-pleasing menu of generously portioned pasta (the rye campanelle and buckwheat pappardelle are must-orders) plus entrees to share, like the crispy porchetta with sausage stuffing and crispy fingerling potatoes. If Rae’s Roman tripe stew is on the menu, count yourself lucky and order it straight away.\\n\\nBar Mezzana\\n\\nIt’s all about the lobster paccheri, folks. But also any other pasta dish, any crudo, and it should not be an option to leave without ordering dessert. Just order the whole menu at Bar Mezzana, which features coastal Italian cuisine.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoppa\\n\\nWhile Ken Oringer and longtime business partner Jamie Bissonnette recently parted ways, lucky for diners that this South End enoteca is still standing strong. Oringer has taken over sole ownership of the spot, which does a particularly good job with cheese and cured meats; Definitely get the beef heart pastrami when available. But don’t forget the pastas: The cavatelli is a must.\\n\\nSRV\\n\\nSRV (which stands for Serene Republic of Venice) is a bacaro and wine bar serving cuisine inspired by the Adriatic right in Boston’s South End. Go with friends and get at least one of each cicchetti option (Venetian small plates), but also try some of the creative pasta dishes, such as the balanzoni with espresso, pork, mushrooms, and smoked ricotta, or the agnolotti in brodo with beet, orange, and poppy seeds.\\n\\nBar Volpe\\n\\nUnlike its northern Italian predecessor, the Fox & the Knife, chef Karen Akunowicz’s Bar Volpe places emphasis on the phenomenal flavors of southern Italy. The South Boston restaurant serves as both a dining room and a store where fresh pasta can be bought by the pound to take home. Make sure to try the hand-crafted Sardinian culurgiones stuffed with goat cheese and potato served over a tomato basil sauce.\\n\\nMida\\n\\nWith spots in Newton, East Boston, and Fenway joining chef and owner Douglass Williams’ original South End location, it might be inevitable to one day have a Mida in every neighborhood. And a wonder that would be — with crispy arancini with San Marzano tomato sauce, and braised pork tagliatelle with radicchio, chile flakes, and Grana Padano cheese from the north of Italy — just a few steps away. Get the braised short rib lasagna. Ditto for the tiramisu. You won’t regret it.\\n\\nLa Morra\\n\\nThis Brookline mainstay tends to lean in the direction of northern Italy, based on owners Josh and Jen Ziskin’s time in Italy’s Piedmont region. For a taste of as much of the menu as possible, try the prix-fixe menu with optional wine pairings.\\n\\nTonino\\n\\nThis Jamaica Plain gem has garnered an enthusiastic following since it opened in October 2022.
