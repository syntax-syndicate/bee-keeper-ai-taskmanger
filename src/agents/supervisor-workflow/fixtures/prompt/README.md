# Skills

1. Goal-and-requirement extraction Example: Given “Organise a three-day team
   off-site near Prague in late September, dog-friendly, <$4 000 total”, the
   agent pulls out dates, location radius, pet policy, and budget ceilings
   before planning.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE quality

2. Resource matching & capability mapping Example: The agent sees that a
   “soil-quality survey” request can be satisfied by an existing
   soil_sampler_droid agent plus a lab_analysis_api, so it chooses those instead
   of generic LLM steps.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE Matching tools

3. Task decomposition & ordered sequencing Example: Break “Digitise 12 medieval
   charters” into: (1) high-res scan, (2) OCR Latin script, (3) language
   detection, (4) human-readable output review, (5) archive to vector store.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE YES

4. Explicit dependency tracking Example: When drafting a crop-rotation plan,
   Step 4 (fertiliser schedule) is formally linked to yield predictions
   generated in Step 2.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE quality

5. Constraint satisfaction (cost, time, capacity) Example: Plan drone battery
   swaps so that each field pass stays under 25 min flight time and total
   batteries ≤ 6.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE YES

6. Parallelisation & critical-path optimisation Example: While 3-D scanning an
   artefact, the agent schedules a separate material-analysis request in
   parallel, shortening total turnaround.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE YES

7. Budget / resource-usage optimisation Example: Choose a rail-cargo route over
   air freight once the combined_cost_evaluator shows 18 % savings within
   deadline tolerances.

   > > > SHOULD HAVE ???

8. Fallback / contingency planning Example: If weather_api predicts > 70 % rain
   on harvest day, automatically branch to an indoor grain-drying workflow.

   > > > Not support yet

9. Progress monitoring & re-planning Example: After Step 2 fails to locate a
   4-star hotel under €180/night, dynamically re-plan to widen the search radius
   and re-evaluate cost.

   > > > Not support yet

10. Multi-objective trade-off balancing Example: Select a Formula 1 tyre
    strategy that minimises pit-stop count and maximises stint pace, displaying
    Pareto-front options.

    > > > SHOULD HAVE ???

11. Provenance / audit-trail construction Example: Attach source URLs and
    intermediate file hashes for each dataset ingested into a paleoclimate
    meta-analysis.
    > > > YES
