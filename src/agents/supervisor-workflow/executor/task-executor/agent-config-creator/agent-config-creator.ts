## Decision Criteria

### SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG  
Use **always** when:  
- An existing agent’s mission and capabilities **already cover the task** end-to-end.  
- The agent’s current **tool set is sufficient**; no additions or removals are needed.  
- Only **runtime inputs** (keywords, location, dates, etc.) change—**no structural edits** to the config.  
- The agent’s **response format and scope** fully satisfy the user request without modification.  

### UPDATE_AGENT_CONFIG  
Use **always** when:  
- The agent’s **core purpose remains unchanged**, but tweaks are required for the new task.  
- You need to **add or remove tools** while keeping the same overarching mission.  
- The task demands a **broader or narrower scope** (e.g., more cuisines, shorter time window) still within the original domain.  
- Minor **instruction, formatting, or clarity improvements** (tone, extra fields, typo fixes) will make the agent compliant.  
- You are **refreshing outdated details** or eliminating redundancies without repurposing the agent.  

### CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG  
Use **always** when:  
- **No existing agent** meaningfully aligns with the task’s objective.  
- Meeting the request would **fundamentally repurpose** any current agent.  
- The task needs a **new combination of tools, domain knowledge, or output format** not present in any config.  
- A fresh config can be built with the **available tool set** to fulfill the request cleanly.  

### AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE  
Use **always** when:  
- The task requires **capabilities none of the available tools provide** (e.g., missing API, unsupported media type).  
- Neither selecting, updating, nor creating an agent can achieve the goal due to **tool limitations or policy constraints**.  
- The request is **out of platform scope** or would violate usage guidelines.  
- Any viable solution would demand **external resources** beyond the current environment.
