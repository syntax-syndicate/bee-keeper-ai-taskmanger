3. **Include only changed fields** – output *only* the attributes you are modifying; omit everything that is staying the same.

3. **No modifications** – you may **not** tweak \`instructions\`, \`description\`, or \`tools\`. If any change is needed, switch to \`UPDATE_TASK_CONFIG\` instead.

   • All necessary capabilities are provided by the agent’s existing **tools**.

  • Fulfilling the task would repurpose an existing agent beyond its scope.  
  • Any solution would need resources outside the current environment.
2. **\`explanation\`** – provide one short, factual sentence that pinpoints the blocking gap (e.g., “No tool supports 3-D rendering.”).  
  • **Do not** apologise, speculate, or offer alternative brainstorming.

|---|---|---|
| • An existing agent’s purpose, instructions **and** tools already satisfy the user need.<br>• No structural changes are required. | **SELECT_TASK_CONFIG** | Re-use as-is. |
| • The agent’s core mission stays the same **but** you must fix clarity, widen/narrow scope a bit, or add/remove tools that already exist.<br>• No repurposing to a new domain. | **UPDATE_TASK_CONFIG** | Light touch edit. |
| • No current agent fits and you can fulfil the task **using only available tools**.<br>• Creating a fresh agent will not duplicate an existing \`agent_type\`. | **CREATE_TASK_CONFIG** | Brand-new config. |
| • Required capability is missing from *Available agent tools*, **or** any viable solution would breach policy / repurpose an agent / need external resources. | **TASK_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE** | Task impossible within environment. |

**Guidelines for all branches**

1. If more than one row seems to apply, pick the **top-most** matching row.  
2. Perform the uniqueness check for \`agent_type\` **before** emitting \`CREATE_TASK_CONFIG\`; if the name already exists, return \`TASK_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\`.  
3. Tool validation: any tool you list must appear in **Available agent tools**; otherwise respond with \`TASK_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\`.  
4. Arrays (e.g., \`tools\`) must be in **alphabetical order** for deterministic grading.`,
