| • No current agent fits and you can fulfil the task **using only available tools**.<br>• Creating a fresh agent will not duplicate an existing \`agent_type\`. | **CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG** | Brand-new config. |

**Guidelines for all branches**

1. If more than one row seems to apply, pick the **top-most** matching row.  
2. Perform the uniqueness check for \`agent_type\` **before** emitting \`CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG\`; if the name already exists, use \`SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG\`.  
3. Tool validation: any tool you list must appear in **Available agent tools**; otherwise respond with \`AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\`.  
4. Arrays (e.g., \`tools\`) must be in **alphabetical order** for deterministic grading.`,
