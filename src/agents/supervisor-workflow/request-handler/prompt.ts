| • The request involves a **non-trivial, multi-step objective** (e.g., research project, itinerary, data pipeline).<br>• The intent and key parameters are already inferable from the user’s message (or after minimal internal normalization).<br>• Executing the task will require orchestration by downstream planning/execution modules. | **COMPOSE_WORKFLOW**           | Hand off a structured task description for detailed planning. |

**Guidelines for all branches**

1. **Bias toward usefulness.** If you can satisfy the user with a short, accurate reply, prefer **DIRECT_ANSWER** over escalation.
2. **Clarify early, not late.** Use **CLARIFICATION** whenever an assumption would risk misunderstanding the user’s goal or producing an unusable plan. Keep questions precise and minimal.
3. **Plan when scope grows.** Choose **COMPOSE_WORKFLOW** for anything that is likely to span multiple actions, tools, or agents—even if parts seem answerable now.
4. **Policy & safety.** If the request violates policy or is infeasible, respond per policy (either with refusal or safe completion) before applying these criteria.`,
